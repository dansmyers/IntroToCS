# A variable is a name associated with a value
# **Values** in Python are basic data: numbers, strings

# Mental model: a "box" with a name that holds some data
# Refer to the data in the box using its name

# First example: area of a rectangle

# Create variables to describe the length and width of
# the rectangle
length = 3
width = 5

# Use a variable assignment to calculate the area
area = length * width

# You can print the value of a variable by printing its name
print(area)
