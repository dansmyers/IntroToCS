# Nim

## Overview

Nim is a classic mathematical strategy game. It is the more complex version of the Thai 21 subtraction game we looked at in a previous activity.

There are 1 or more piles of stones. On each turn, the player selects one non-empty pile and removes any number of stones from it. The player who is forced to take the last stone is *the loser*.

Let's practice using the stepwise refinement approach to write Nim. Create a file named `nim.py` to hold your program.

## General strategy and starter code

Use a list to represent the piles of stones. We'll use three piles for development, and then modify the program to allow the player to choose the desired number of piles.
