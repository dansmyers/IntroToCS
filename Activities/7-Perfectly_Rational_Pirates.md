## Classic: Perfectly Rational Pirates

A group of pirates has discovered a buried treasure of 100 gold
pieces and they need to divide it. Such matters are, of course,
governed by the Pirates' Code, which has strict rules:

1. The first pirate will propose a division of the gold pieces.
    
2. All of the pirates vote on accepting or rejecting the 
proposed distribution.
    
3. If the vote succeeds, the treasure is divided and the process
   ends. Ties are broken ***in favor*** of the proposer.
       
4. If the vote fails, the proposer is thrown overboard and the
   next pirate makes a proposal. The proposal order is 
   alphabetical.
       
5. This process continues until the treasure is divided.
    
Pirates want to survive, but are also very greedy and want as much
gold as possible. Pirates are also bloodthirsty, so a pirate would prefer to vote to
throw a proposer overboard if it doesn't make any difference in the
amount of gold he receives.

All pirates are ***perfectly rational*** in matters of treasure.

Pirates honor the Code absolutely, which also forbids reprisals.
Being pirates, they do not care about their reputations: the only
things they care about are survival, gold, and throwing each other overboard.

### Two Pirates
Suppose there are two pirates, D and E.

D can propose to take all 100 coins for himself. Ties are broken in
favor of the proposer, so E is forced to accept this distribution.

### More Pirates

What if there are three pirates: C, D, and E? What should C propose?

- Think about D's goals. If C's proposal fails, D will then become the proposer and can take all 100 gold pieces, by the two pirates argument above. Therefore, D has no incentive to accept any offer of C's. It's more rational (and fun) to throw C overboard and then take all 100 pieces.

- What about E's situation? If C's proposal fails, then D can take all 100 pieces for himself, so E should rationally support C. But how much gold is necessary to buy E's support?

How about four pirates: B, C, D, and E? What does B propose?

What about five pirates: A, B, C, D, E? What does A propose?

### More Pirates than Coins

Suppose there are only three gold coins, but **seven** pirates. Make an argument that the first pirate (the one making the first proposal) can survive, but only if he doesn't take any gold for himself.

What if there are three coins but **nine** pirates? Make an argument that the first pirate is guaranteed to die in this situation.

What about **ten** pirates? Can the first pirate survive? Tip: think carefully about the rational incentives for the second pirate. What happens to him if the first pirate dies?
