# Tic-Tac-Toe feat. Stepwise Refinement

## Overview

**Stepwise refinement** is a programming strategy that empahsizes breaking a complex problem down into discrete substeps, then implementing a function to perform each substep. Those functions might themselves consist of multiple steps, which can be broken down and implemented as their own functions.
