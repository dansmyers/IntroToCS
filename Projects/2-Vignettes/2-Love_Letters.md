# Strachey's Love Letter Algorithm

## Overview

Christopher Strachey was an early British computer programmer. Born in 1916, he attended Cambridge at the same time as Alan Turing, the father of computer science. Strachey did not do well in his studies and took an industry position after graduation where he became interested in emerging computing technologies.

Strachey began programming in the 1950s. He wrote a program to play checkers that may have been the first video game. He also created the first computer music program (it played "God Save the Queen"). He went on to pioneering work in a number of areas of computer science, including developing the concept of time-sharing in operating systems, which turned out to be a big deal.

The "Love Letter Algorithm" dates from abut 1952. It was a program that could automatically compose love letters, for certain definitions of "love" and "letters". Wikipedia records the following example,
> Darling Sweetheart,
>
>You are my avid fellow feeling. My affection curiously clings to your passionate wish. My liking yearns for your heart. You are my wistful sympathy: my tender liking.
>
>Yours beautifully
>
>M. U. C.
