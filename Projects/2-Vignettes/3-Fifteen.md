## Overview

**Fifteen** is a basic dice game, one of a family of accumulating games that involve rolling dice to get as close as possible to a target without going over.

Our version will use the following rules:

- Roll three six-sided dice and add their sum
- If the sum is equal to 15, the player wins immediately
- If the sum is greater than 15, the player loses immediately
- If the sum is less than 15 the player may choose to roll one more die and add it to the score
- Announce the player's score
- Print a message depending on whether the score was less than, equal to, or greater than 15

## Sample Output

```
Welcome to the Fifteen game.
Rolling three dice...
The dice are 5, 3, and 1.
Your score is 9.
Would you like to roll again?
1. Yes
2. No
Enter your choice: 1
You rolled a 6.
Your total score is 15.
Perfect!
```

## AI Use

As with the other problems, you can use AI freely to help you. Remember:

- You need to follow the output format given above and use the techniques we've talked about in class. Don't allow the AI to give you code that's more complex that what we've done so far.

- Keep a log of your interactions. If you generate code, I want to see your assessment of it, how you incorporate it into the program, and how you know it's reasonable. Log any iterations that you make to modify the code.

## Testing

For this problem you need to add one more step. Prompt the AI to help you develop a plan for testing your program:

*I've written the following Python program that implements a small dice game.*
*<PASTE PROGRAM HERE>*
*Give me suggestions for testing it so I can be sure that it works correctly. Don't write any test code for me. Give me a plan I can follow to test the program myself. Explain your reasoning.*

Log prompt and response in your log. Then carry out the testing plan and log the results.
