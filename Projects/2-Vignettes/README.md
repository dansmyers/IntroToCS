# Project 2: Vignettes

## Due Friday, 9/27

## Overview

This project will allow you practice using conditionals and random choices in a few short programs.

Complete the three problems linked above. These problems aren't that hard, but they require you to make some design decisions and they'll be a little longer than most programs we've written up to this point.

- Read the problem descriptions carefully. I've given tips on how to complete each one.
- Each solution should be in one Python file. Use the standards we've developed for styling and commenting your code.

This assignment will also give you some practice testing your code in a structured way.

## Setup
Create a `Project_2` directory in your Codespace:
```
mkdir Project_2
```
You can the `cd` into it:
```
cd Project_2
```
Remember that if you're working in one of your directories and want to move to `Project_2` you can do that by moving up one level (represented by `..` in the shell) and then moving to the project:
```
cd ../Project_2
```

## AI Use

**You are allowed to use AI freely on this assignment**. I want you to experiment with crafting your own prompts to produce solutions for the problems. Some guidelines

- Only use features we've talked about in class. In particular, don't include `def` statements, `try`, loops, or lists. The AI may try to generate code that's more complex that what you need. You may need to reign it in.

- Keep a log document for each problem showing your interactions. Record each prompt, the AI response, and then explain how you used that output.

All three problems give you opportunities to make some design choices. Make them! Have a vision for what the program should do and use AI to help you execute it. Don't outsource your thinking!

## Don't Use Functions (Yet)

We'll be talking about functions while you're working on this assignment. **Don't** use any functions or `def` statements in this project; I want you to practie using `if` statements and making choices. We'll save those for the next project.

## Submission

Submit your three Python scripts and three AI logs (one for each problem) to the assignment I'll create on Canvas.
