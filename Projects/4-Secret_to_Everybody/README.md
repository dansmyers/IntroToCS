## Due Friday, 4/18

## Description

This project will allow you to work on two topics related to secrets: codebreaking using frequency analysis and password cracking. Along the way you'll be able to:

- Practice using files, string processing, and dictionaries
- Learn about hash functions and password security

Complete both parts in the two directories linked above.

## AI

As before, you can use AI to help you if you keep a log of your interactions. Remember that the AI may try to generate code that's way too complicated: stay on top of what your program actually needs to do and don't use code that has unnecessary features.

Note that most of the work for this project is in understanding the problem and reasoning through the steps involved.

## Submission


Submit the following files to the assignment on Canvas:

- `decode.py`
- `crack.py`
- Your AI log document
- Another document with your answers to the short questions at the end of part 2
