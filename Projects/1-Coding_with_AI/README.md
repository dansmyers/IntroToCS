## Setup

## Improving an Existing Program

Start with the file `smoots.py` in this directory. It uses all of the techniques we've discussed in the first two weeks of class (input, variables, formatted printing) to implement the Smoots converter that we've seen before, but the style is poor.

Create a blank Word document named `style.doc`. In your document, analyze this program. Explain what style elements in should have, but doesn't. How would you improve it? You don't need to rewrite the entire program, but provide a list of corrections that should be made.

**After you have done that**, go to ChatGPT. Ask it to provide commentary on the program using the following prompt:
> Take a look at the following Python program, which implements a unit converter using input, variables, and printing. Act as a code reviewer and identify ways to improve it style. Don't rewrite the program, just give me a list of suggested improvements.
