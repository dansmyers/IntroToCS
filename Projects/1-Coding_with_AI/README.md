# Project 1: Coding with AI

## Overview


## Setup

## Improving an Existing Program

Start with the file `smoots.py` in this directory. It uses all of the techniques we've discussed in the first two weeks of class (input, variables, formatted printing) to implement the Smoots converter that we've seen before, but the style is poor.

Create a blank Word document named `style.doc`. In your document, analyze this program. Explain what style elements in should have, but doesn't. How would you improve it? You don't need to rewrite the entire program, but provide a list of corrections that should be made.

**After you have done that** (not before), go to ChatGPT. Ask it to provide commentary on the program using the following prompt:

*Take a look at the following Python program, which implements a unit converter using input, variables, and printing.*<br/>
*[PASTE PROGRAM HERE]* <br/>
*Act as a code reviewer and identify ways to improve its style. Don't rewrite the program or suggest any changes to its behavior, just give me a list of suggested style improvements.*

Read ChatGPT's output and copy it into your `style.doc` file, then provide your own assessment of ChatGPT's suggestions. Do they agree with the ones you made at the start? Did ChatGPT suggest anything you didn't? Do you *disagree* with any of ChatGPT's suggestions?

Once you've reviewed ChatGPT's suggestions, use them to improve the program.


## Unimproving an Existing Program

You're now going to experiment with adding an error to a program and using ChatGPT to find and fix it. Start with the file `binet.py` in this directory, which implements Binet's formula. Copy it into your workspace, run it, and verify that it works correctly.


Do the following steps in a Word document called `error.doc`:

- Describe, in words, the error that you're adding to the program. What lines are you changing, and what problem will that create?
- Paste your modified code with the error into your document.
- Run the modified program and paste the error message that you get into your document. Make sure that this is the error you expected.

Prompt ChatGPT to find and fix the error:

*I'm writing the following Python program*<br/>
*[PASTE PROGRAM HERE]*<br/>
*I received the following error message when I ran the program:*<br/>
*[PASTE ERROR MESSAGE HERE]*
*Explain the error and suggest corrected lines of code to fix it. Don't rewrite the complete program for me, just give me the statements that need to be fixed.*

Copy ChatGPT's output to your document, then check its fix. Does it fix the problem?

### Keep Making Things Worse

Repeat the previous section **two more times**, following the same steps, but choosing different errors for each step. Log all of your writing and responses in `error.doc`.
