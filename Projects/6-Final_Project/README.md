*Early Morning River Scene*, Harold Newton (ca. 1978)

Newton was one of the "[Florida Highwaymen](https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2014.185.10ab?destination=/explore/collection/search%3Fedan_q%3D%252A%253A%252A%26edan_fq%255B0%255D%3Dplace%253A%2522Fort%252BPierce%2522%26op%3DSearch)", a group of mostly self-taught African-American artists active in the area around Fort Pierce in the mid-20th Century. The Highwaymen primarily painted Florida landscapes, often with unrealistically vibrant colors. Their paintings were made quickly with non-standard materials and sold by the side of the road.

## Description

This is it, the final project.

**Make anything you want**, as long as it's awesome and uses the Python features that we've learned over the course of the semester. Most of you will probably want to make some sort of game, but note that isn't required. I have some ideas for you at the end of the document.

## Pairs

**If you choose**, you may work with one other person to complete this project.

- You may write code collaboratively with other members of your partner, but remember to pay attention to the guidelines below on acceptable use of resources.

- If you work with someone it would be cool to undertake a more ambitious project worthy of your combined efforts.

## Requirements

1. Awesomeness.

2. Uses basic features of Python: variables, loops, conditional statements, and functions. Almost any reasonably complex program is going to satisfy these requirements. If your program doesn't include most of these features then it might be too simple. **You must include at least one instance of each of these features**.
   
3. Uses at least one advanced data organization feature: a list, a class, or a dictionary. I'm not requiring any particular number of these, because the best choice depends on the nature of your program.
   
4. Demonstrates good programming style (indentation, variable names) and includes descriptive comments explaining what's happening in the program.

5. You may use AI as much as you want. As in the previous projects, keep a log of your interactions. What I want to see, more than anything, is **iteration** and evidence that you're using AI as a tool to execute your own vision.
   
## Grading

I'll run your program and look at the source code. I'll be checking:

1. Does it work? I want to see something that could be considered a complete working program, not an incomplete fragment. It's better to turn in a complete, working program that you know could be improved than an ambitious but unfinished one.

2. Does it use the features of Python that we've discussed? Follow the guidelines given above.

3. Does it follow good coding style, as we've used in class and in labs?

## Acceptable Use of Resources

It is acceptable to use the Internet to get ideas and figure out how to implement features you need for your projects. However, **the work you submit must be your own original creation**, or in the case of a group collaboration, your group's original creation. Copying another program and presenting it as your own is unacceptable and will result in automatic failure and a potential Honor Code violation.

**It is acceptable** to research solutions to programming problems and incorporate them into your code. For example, if you need to convert a string to a list, you could look up how to to do that and then use the solution you find. That's an acceptable use of documentation. You **don't** need to provide citations for basic language features or solutions like these.

**You may use ChatGPT or another AI model as a resource**. However, you must use it as a **source** that aids your own development, not as a substitute for your own design and thinking. For this project, it's not acceptable to prompt AI to create an entire program, then copy that and present it as your complete submission. If you're working on a project that can be trivially solved with AI, then your project is too easy. Be ambitious and challenge yourself!

## Invalid Projects

Please don't choose any of the following ideas. They're either too easy, too generic, or trivial to implement with AI tools.

- Hangman, or any similar word guessing game. Wordle, however, is more interesting and acceptable.
- Other simple pen and paper games are acceptable a long as they require some real effort and thinking on your part. Rule of thumb: If an AI can one-shot it, I don't want to grade it.
- Text-based quizzes in Python like Challenge Project 1.

## Tips

- **Start early**! Don't wait until the last minute!

- Start with the simplest idea that could work, get it to work, then build up from there. It's better to have a complete program that does
what it's supposed to do than an ambitious but incomplete idea. Develop incrementally and test as you go!

- Use our previous examples. They illustrate many different concepts that could be useful for your own programs.

## Ideas

A good project is one that lets you combine the techniques you've already learned with something new that you need to research.

### Getting suggestions

Remember that AI is great at coming up with ideas. You could try a prompt like the following:

> Suggest ideas for the final project in my Python programming class. I need to use all the basic features of Python (variables, loops, functions, etc.) and at least one advanced features (list, dictionary, or class). The project should not be a basic word game or anything else that can be generated by an AI with minimal effort on my part.

Pick ideas that seem interesting and drill down into something specific. If you don't like any of the suggestions, just ask for more.

### GPT or other APIs

You could create another project that uses the GPT API, like we did in Project 3. There are other web-based services that you can call to get access to data or useful tools. Any project built around using a third-party tool would be excellent.

If you choose to go this route, make sure that you're not just producing another implementation of Project 3.

### Images

You could return to the image-processing library from Project 1. What could you do with that now that you know significantly more programming?

### Adventure game

You could make a text-based adventure game, where the player is exploring a map of locations, finding items, solving puzzles, and so forth. This is similar to Project 3, but more structured and conventionally game-like.

AI likes to suggest this as project concept and it's a good use of classes to manage information in the game. Note that you *could* combine this with the GPT API to generate some descriptions, but you don't have to and may want little or no AI randomness.

### Ancient Algorithms

Look up some ancient techniques for things like multiplication, division, square roots, and other math operations. Write a library of your own implementations.

### Data Projects

If you would prefer to answer a data question, you can find a data set, load it into Pandas, and produce a graph answering your question. If you take this approach, you don't have to write a "report," but do provide a summary of the question, your data source, and an interpretation of the plot that answers the question, similar to what we did in Project 5.

### Once More with Feeling

Pick some problems from the earlier homeworks (like Project 2) and rewrite them in a different language, like JavaScript. You'll have to look up the relevant syntax for things like functions and loops. Note that user input in JS is much harder than in Python, since it's meant to run in the browser, so don't attempt any programs that require user interaction unless you want a real challenge.
