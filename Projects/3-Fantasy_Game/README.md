*Wizardry*, one of the most influential computer games of all time, via [the CRPG Addict blog](https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2010/02/game-5-wizardry-proving-grounds-of-mad.html)

*Dungeons and Dragons* is the archetypal fantasy roleplaying game, where players take on the roles of adventurers exploring a fantasy world, guided by a "dungeon master" who determines the course of the story and evaluates the results of players' decisions by rolling dice. Lots of dice.

The earliest computer RPGs, like *Wizardry* (1981), borrowed heavily from the basic concepts of D n' D, with the computer taking on the role of the dungeon master. However, computer games always failed to reproduce the truly open-ended worlds of interactive tabletop RPGs, since they were limited by what the designers could code into the game.

Let's jump forward almost 40 years to 2019, when a Brigham Young University student named Nick Walton [created *AI Dungeon*](https://if50.substack.com/p/2019-ai-dungeon). *AI Dungeon* used the then-cutting-edge text generation program ***GPT-2*** to create interactive narratives that could grow and expand over time.

This project will allow you to continue experimenting with the OpenAI API by using it to write your own fantasy exploration game. You will:

- Choose the theme and setting of your game
- Give the player a starting scene and some initial choices
- Prompt GPT to continue the story, generating the next scene or room and more choices for the player

Along the way, you'll get to practice using loops, lists, functions, and the other features we've developed so far.

## Review the basic chatbot

The starting point for this project is the basic chatbot from Lab 8. Review that code and make sure you understand how it's implemented and how to use the OpenAI API before continuing with this project.

## Guidelines

This project is intentionally open-ended. You can choose the setting, themes, etc. based on your interests. If you want to choose something other than a [Standard Fantasy Setting](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFantasySetting), you can do that.
