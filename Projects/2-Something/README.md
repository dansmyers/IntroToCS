Is there a better way to learn about yourself than answering nonsensical questions written by randos on the Internet? I think not! I've taken a bunch of these over the years and I've learned all kinds of things.

- Hogwarts house? (Slytherin, but I'd pretend to be Hufflepuff).
- Disney heroine? (Maid Marian from *Robin Hood*).
- [Myers-Briggs personality type](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/the-16-mbti-types.htm)? (INTP).
- [Enneagram type](https://www.narrativeenneagram.org/tour-the-nine-types/)? (3, and far more useful than Myers-Briggs, in my opinion).
- [Pok√©mon type](https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarahtooley5/what-pokamon-type-are-you-248el1snke)? (Poison).
- [Minor villain from *Jojo's Bizarre Adventure*](https://www.buzzfeed.com/puppetmaster64/which-minor-jojo-villain-are-you-42nxcnqrfi)? (Steely Dan, and I didn't even have to make that up).

Buzzfeed is still the leading purveyor of these online quizzes, offering insight into, for example, [what kitchen appliance you are based on your food preferences](https://www.buzzfeed.com/catmjohnston/which-kitchen-appliance-are-you-based-on-your-food-8arc2wkfy8). (Microwave, apparently).

In this project, you're going to use your knowledge of culture, relationships, and Python to write a program that implements a Buzzfeed-style personality quiz. Your quiz can be about anything that you want, as long as it's your own original implementation.

The goal of this program is to write a completely self-designed program that is larger than anything we've done so far.
