# Hello, World!

## Writing a program that prints

Go to [trinket.io/python3] to access the interactive environment we used in class. Highlight and then delete any pre-existing code in the left pane.

Click in the left pane, then type
```
print('Hello, World!')
```
This is the basic Python command to print a line of text to the output terminal. It has three important parts:

- The command `print`, which is the basic Python command to print output

- A pair of parentheses. Like a mathematical function, `print` takes an *argument*, which is enclosed in parentheses.
  
- The text string `Hello, World!`, which is the text that we want to print. Text strings in Python are enclosed in a pair of *single quotes*, to indicate that this is **literal text** that should be reproduced exactly.
