## Data types

Every data value in a Python program has a *type*. There are four basic Python data types:

1. `int` is the type of the positive and negative whole numbers, including 0. Examples: `5`, `0`, `-1001`

2. `str` is the string type. Anything enclosed in single or double quotes is a string. Examples: `'hello'`, `'5'`, `'True'`

3. `float` is the type of decimal numbers. The name refers to the internal *floating point* data format used to represent non-integer values in computers. Any number with a decimal point is a `float`. Examples: `1.01`, `3.14, `5.0`

4. `bool` is the *Boolean* data type, used to represent logical true and false values. There are two special Boolean values, `True` and `False`, and these are the only values that have the `bool` type.
