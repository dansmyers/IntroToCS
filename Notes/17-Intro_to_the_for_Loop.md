## Types of loops

Python has two looping keywords: `for` and `while`.

The `for` loop is used to iterate over **sequences**. The following are all examples of sequences in Python:

- The characters in a string
- A range of numbers
- The lines of file
- The values in a list

The `for` loop can also be used to run a block of code a fixed number of times.

The `while` loop is controlled by a **boolean condition** and runs as long as its condition is `True`.
