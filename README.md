## Official Course Description

**CMS 120 Introduction to Computer Science**. Introduction to fundamental aspects of programming using a high-level language, focusing on problem solving, software design concepts, and their realization as computer programs. Topics include: variables, using existing classes, selection and iteration, and arrays. Classroom activities are used to gain mastery of these principles. Co-requisite: CMS 120L

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course, you will

1. Be able to write programs using core features of the Python language, including variables, conditionals, functions, and loops.

2. Write programs using Python's built-in list and dictionary data structures.

3. Be able to write programs that conform to a written specification and are evaluated using automated testing.

4. Understand and use methods of sound program design, such as abstraction and stepwise refinement, to design solutions to open-ended
programming problems.

5. Read and comprehend program source code.

6. Be familiar with common terminology from computer science and programming and the fundamentals of computer organization, systems, and data representation.

7. Use artificial intelligence tools in a collaborative way to support programming

## Labs

This class has a co-requisite of CMS 120L Introduction to Computer Science Lab. We'll complete a total of **six** hypothesis-based lab activities during the semester. Other lab sessions will focus on building your core programming skills by completing practice problems and activities.

Together, CMS 120 and 120L may substitute for the required **rFLA 200-level Science class**, which reduces the number of 200-level classes you need to complete to satisfy your rFLA requirements. I'll talk about how to do this later in the semester.

CMS 120 and the lab are listed as separate sections but you'll receive the **same grade** for both. Completing the labs is one component of your final grade, discussed below.

## Textbook

We'll be using the free interactive online text called *Python for Everybody* published by Runestone. The book has chapters with interactive questions that you'll complete as part of each reading assignment.

## The All-Important Grading Section

### Specs Grading
Grading for this course will be different from your previous classes.

Rather than calculating your score as number of points on a 0-100 scale, your grade will be based on attaining **satisfactory** performance on a bundle of assignments. This approach is called **Specifications Grading** or **Contract Grading** and it has several advantages over the traditional 0-100 based points system.

If you achieve satisfactory performance on enough assigments, described in more detail below, you'll receive a baseline grade of **B** for the course. This demonstrates that you have engaged with the material and met the basic learning outcomes for the class. To get a higher grade, you can do more work that shows greater mastery of the course learning outcomes.

### Labs
You must be registered for a section of CMS 120L. You'll receive the **same grade** for both CMS 120 and CMS 120L.

### Assignments
We'll have five kinds of assignments in this class:

1. **Autograded reading questions** from the Runestone text. These are easy to answer if you complete the required reading.

2. A set of **six out-of-class programming assignments**. These involve writing larger, more substantial programs that combine multiple techniques. They also require you to practice program development skills.

3. The **CMS120L lab meetings**. Each lab consists of practice programs or activities to reinforce the topics we're covering that week. Six of the labs also incorporate hypothesis-based data collection that allows this course to account for the RFLA Science requirement. The labs will be graded on **completion** and I'll be there with you during each session to help you and check your work-in-progress.

4. Written midterm and final exams. The midterm will be given in-class on the day specified on the calendar and the final will be given at the time scheduled by the college. The final is not cumulative, but unavoidably builds upon the techniques that we cover in the first part of the class. The focus of both exams will be **reading and understanding program code**.

### Satisfactory Credit

I will grade most of the items you turn in on a two-level scale: your work will be either **satisfactory** or receive **no credit**. "Satisfactory" means that the work is:

1. Substantially complete and correct (there may be a few issues, but only minor ones).
2. Shows real understanding and application of the course material.
3. Completed on time in the required format.

For programming assignments, you must make a fair attempt on every problem. For reading, you must complete 90% of the assigned problems in order to receive credit.

### Letter Grades

**To earn an A**, you must meet the following criteria:

1. Satisfactory completion of the six major programming assignments.
2. Satisfactory completion of 12 of the 13 labs. You can miss one lab without it affecting your grade.
3. Earn a score of at least 80% on both the midterm and final exams.
4. Complete the autograded questions in the assigned reading. To allow some flexibility, the threshold for receiving credit is 90% of the assigned questions.

**If you fail to complete the requirements for an A**, your grade will be adjusted downwards according to the following table:

| Performance             | Your grade will be adjusted downwards by |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Unsatisfactory major programming assignemnt | One full letter grade (e.g., A to B)     |
| Missing more than the one allowed lab | Fraction of a letter grade for the first missed lab (e.g., A to A-) |
| Additional missed labs       | One full letter grade for each |
| Incomplete reading assignment | Fraction of a letter grade for each |
| Score between 60% and 80% on an exam         | Fraction of a letter grade   |
| Score of less than 60% on an exam       | One full letter grade  |

These penalties are cumulative. For example, if you failed to satisfactorily complete two major projects, your base grade would be lowered by 2 letters, from A to C.

### Why Are You Doing This To Us?

1. In a traditional system, your grade is ultimately determined by my judgment of your work. My judgment is pretty good, but specs grading gives you more clarity about where you stand and guidance for how to achieve the grade you want

2. Your grade is directly tied to the learning that you demonstrate. The satisfactory work sets a baseline, but to earn a higher grade, you must demonstrate a higher level of engagement with the course material.

3. It's relatively easy to get a B if you do the required work, but hard to get an A. This preserves the integrity of the course, while still making it possible for everyone to succeed.

4. If you only need a B or a C, you can adjust your effort accordingly: the standards are transparent. You don't have to spend time on the most difficult assignments if you don't need them to get the result you want.

5. It reflects how you'll be evaluated in your career. Work assignments aren't graded out of 100% and your boss won't give partial credit for incomplete work. So, basically, I'm setting you up for massive career success.

### I Feel Decidedly Uncomfortable

This is probably a new approach to grading for you. In particular, students new to specs grading often have anxiety about the lack of partial credit in the system.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. **You don't have to be perfect**. The "substantially complete and correct" standard allows for imperfections in your answers and you only need 90% for the reading and most assignments, so you don't have to correctly answer, or even attempt, every problem, so long as your cumulative work meets the required standard.

2. **You do need to be consistent**. The system rewards you for putting forward good, consistent effort.

3. **Attend the labs**. The lab sessions are your main place to practice programming skills. Make sure you attend every lab session.

4. **You will get lots of feedback**. I will be there with you in lab to check on your work. The major projects will have clear standards describing what's required to receive full credit.

## Other Course Policies

**Attendance** The only way to be consistently successful in your academic career is to regularly attend class meetings and participate in in-class activities. Therefore, while I do not mandate attendance at every single class, I expect full attendance every time we meet. **Don't attend class if you're sick**.

**Laptops** If you have a laptop, please bring it to class.

**Phones** Unlike laptops, I see few advantages to using phones during class. Please silence your phones at the beginning of class. Holding text conversations during class is both distracting and disrespectful and will not be tolerated.

**Late submissions** Assignments are due on the stated day at the stated time. Speak to me in well in advance of the due date if you need an extension.

**Please speak to me if there are any issues making it difficult for you to succeed in class**. We can always work out a plan to deal with illness, work, or family responsibilities.

**Recording** No audio or video recording is permitted without prior permission.

**Canvas and GitHub** Most of the course material will be distributed through GitHub. We'll use Canvas to keep track of grades, announcements, and a few other things.

## Necessary and Proper Clause

As your course facilitator, I will make every effort to adhere to the topics and schedule described in this syllabus. However, I reserve the right to make changes for the good of the course.

## AI Policy

Large-language artificial intelligence models are changing how professional software developers design and write code. Therefore, it's appropriate for us to practice programming with AI.

However, simply typing prompts into an AI tool and copying its output is not a good use of your time:
- You still need to understand the fundamentals of programming to use AI code generators effectively.
- Anyone can copy and paste; if that's your only skill, then you're adding no value and you are easily replaceable.

In this course, I will **teach you how to use AI collaboratively**. I'll show you techniques for working with AI as a "co-intelligence" that can help you write better code and learn faster.

To achieve this goal, we're going to abide by the following policies:
- Labs are for practicing fundamental skills in-person, so you can't use AI for them unless it's specifically part of the lab activity.
- The out-of-class assignments **are designed to be done with AI**. Each assignment will give you specific suggestions on how to use AI as part of your development process.
- You should complete the reading questions without using AI.
- The in-class midterm uses no written or electronic resources.


## Honor Code
Membership in the student body of Rollins College carries with it an obligation, and requires a commitment, to act with honor in all things. The student commitment to uphold the values of honor--honesty, trust, respect, fairness, and responsibility--particularly manifests itself in two public aspects of student life. First, as part of the admission process to the College, students agree to commit themselves to the Honor Code. Then, as part of the matriculation process during Orientation, students sign a more detailed pledge to uphold the Honor Code and to conduct themselves honorably in all their activities, both academic and social, as a Rollins student. A student signature on the following pledge is a binding commitment by the student that lasts for his or her entire tenure at Rollins College:

> The development of the virtues of Honor and Integrity are integral to a Rollins College education and to membership in the Rollins College community. Therefore, I, a student of Rollins College, pledge to show my commitment to these virtues by abstaining from any lying, cheating, or plagiarism in my academic endeavors and by behaving responsibly, respectfully and honorably in my social life and in my relationships with others. This pledge is reinforced every time a student submits work for academic credit as his/her own. Students shall add to the paper, quiz, test, lab report, etc., the handwritten signed statement:
>
>
> **‚ÄúOn my honor, I have not given, nor received, nor witnessed any unauthorized assistance on this work.‚Äù**
>
>

Material submitted electronically should contain the pledge; submission implies signing the pledge.

## How Do I Interpret the Honor Code?
In the context of this class, my interpretation of the Honor Code pledge is that the work you submit for every assignment shall be your own original creation. This means that any item you submit must be written by you and you alone, or in an assigned group project by your group alone. Copying a complete solution from fellow class members, previous class members, books, or the Internet is a violation of this policy and will constitute academic misconduct.

It is acceptable to discuss questions and solutions in general terms with other class members, but your discussions should not be at a level of detail that would lead to you submitting the same work as a another student.

### Citation	Expectations
As	per	the	Academic	Honor	Code,	plagiarism	is	defined	as	‚ÄúOffering the words, facts,
or ideas of another person as your own in any academic exercise.‚Äù In	order	to	avoid	
plagiarism,	all	students	are	expected	to	use	proper	citation	norms.	For	our	course,	
all	assignments	will	use	[faculty	choice	- MLA,	Chicago,	APA,	etc]	citation	style.	

### Absences	‚Äì Religious	Holidays	and/or	Campus	Business
The	professor	will	accommodate	a	reasonable	number	of	excused	absences	for	
religious	holidays	and	official	off-campus	college	business	such	as	academic	
conference	presentations	and	athletic	competitions.	However,	per	the	College‚Äôs	
policy	on	excused	absences	
(http://www.rollins.edu/catalogue/academic_regulations.html#class-attendance),	
students	must	discuss	with	the	professor	the	dates	of	the	anticipated	absences	no	
later	than	the	last	day	of	the	drop	period.	Students	must	present	to	their	professor	
written	evidence	of	the	anticipated	absences	and	discuss	with	him/her	how	and	
when	make-up	work	should	be	completed	prior	to	missing	the	class.	Students	
should	not	expect	to	receive	allowance	for	excused	absences	if	they	do	not	meet	
with	the	professor	beforehand	and	clarify	the	dates	as	necessary.	Absences	will	be	
addressed	by	the	faculty	member	in	accordance	with	his/her	attendance	policy.	The	
professor	retains	the	right	to	determine	what	would	be	considered	to	be	a	
reasonable	number	of	absences	(excused	or	otherwise)	for	the	course.	A	student	
will	not	fail	a	course	because	the	number	of	religious	observances	and/or	college	
business	absences	exceed	the	number	of	absences	allowed,	except	if	excessive	
absences	make	it	impossible	to	fulfill	the	expectations	of	the	course.	The	student‚Äôs	
class	participation	grade	in	the	course,	though,	may	still	be	affected.
