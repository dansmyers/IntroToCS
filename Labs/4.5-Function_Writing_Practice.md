# Function Writing Practice

This micro-lab will let you practice writing some functions that return results.

## Setup

Create one file named `function_practice.py` in your `Functions` subdirectory:

You can add each function into this file. Write a few lines in the "Main" section to test each new function after you complete it.

## Max of two numbers

Write a function named `max` that takes two input parameters named `a` and `b`. Return the larger of the two input values.

Tip: use an `if-else` block.

Tip-tip: Python has a built-in `max` function, but don't use it for this problem.

```
def max(a, b):
    """
    Return the max of a and b
    """

```

## Area of triangle

Write a function that takes the base and height of a triangle as its input and returns the area.


## dN

Write a function called `roll_dN` that takes one input named `n` and returns the result of rolling an `n`-sided die.


## Negative?

Write a function called `is_negative` that takes a single input number and returns `True` if the number is negative and `False` otherwise.

Tip: You can write the solution to this problem using an `if`-`else` block, but you can also return the result of the boolean test directly.

```
return x < 0
```

## 3d6

Write a function called `three_d6` that returns the result of rolling and adding three six-sided dice. Use the `dN` function that you wrote previously 
to implement this one.


## Binet's Formula
Recall Binet's formula from Assignment 2: it gives a closed-form way of calculating the Fibonacci numbers.

```
F_n = (1 / sqrt(5)) * (phi ** n - phi_hat ** n)
```

Where `phi` is the special **golden ratio**:

```
phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2

phi_hat = (1 - sqrt(5)) / 2
```

Write a function called `binet` that takes a parameter `n` as input and uses it to calculate and return the `n`th Fibonacci number. Write 
some code in the main part of your program to test your function.

Include the line

```
from math import sqrt
```

at the top of your program.

## Banana?

Write a function called `is_banana` that takes a string as input and returns `True` if the string is equal to `banana` and `False` otherwise. Remember that you can use `==` to compare strings in Python.


## Divisible?

Write a function called `divisible_by_7` that takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is divisible by 7 and `False` otherwise.
