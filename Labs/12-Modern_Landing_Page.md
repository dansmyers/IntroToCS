# Build a Modern Landing Page with Bootstrap

## Description

In this lab, you're going to work through a tutorial to build a modern-style landing page website with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. You'll recognize the style as you go: this is pretty much a ubiquitous design that's widely used by brands, particularly within tech and direct-to-consumer retail. For a few examples:

- [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/) (inbound marketing and customer-relationship management tools)
- [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) (major cloud data platform)
- [Clare](https://www.clare.com/) (buying paint online, good example of how site design enhances a fundamentally boring product)
- [Harry's](https://www.harrys.com/en/us) (direct-to-consumer razors)
- [Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com/) (glasses, the OG direct-to-consumer example brand)
- [FTX cryptocurrency exchange](https://ftx.us/?fromIntl=true) (lol)

All of those sites feature custom elements, images, and other features that go beyond what's included in the tutorial, but you'll have a good understanding of how a modern site is put together.

## The Tutorial

The tutorial is here: https://bootstrapious.com/p/big-bootstrap-tutorial. The demo website that you'll build at the end is [here](https://demo.bootstrapious.com/bootstrap-101/).

I've created a repl.it project that is automatically setup with the required structure and image files.

## Tips

Review the notes from last time on Bootstrap if you need to. In particular, pay attention to the column layout guidlines: the page is divided into **rows of twelve columns**.

As we saw, everything in Bootstrap runs off of **`<div>` tags with attached classes**. Each `<div>` represents a region of the page that corresponds to some visual element (e.g., a row section, a column, the navbar). Every `<div>` can have class labels attached to it that tell Bootstrap to apply specific styling rules to that part of the page. The tutorial shows off a number of classes that do different things, beyond simply changing the color or size of the text. You don't need to memorize these, but do read through the parts where it explains what each class is doing to the final layout.

**Read through the tutorial carefully**. There are some parts where you need to put code into `custom.css` and add some extra JavaScript links to the bottom of the body section.

**Check the site after each step**. If it looks strange, you probably missed a step and need to go back in and fix some code. I recommend opening the page in a new tab and refreshing it after each update.

## Customization

The basic site is generic. It uses "[Lorem ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum)" dummy text. To finish the lab, **customize the page contents**. This means,

- Update the page title, flavor text, and descriptions for the icons and portfolio cards.
- Upload new images fitting your page theme to the `img` folder and change the code to link to those images instead of the default ones.

You can choose the topic of your page.
