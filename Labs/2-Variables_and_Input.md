# Lab 2 &ndash; Variables and Input

## Setup

Start your regular in-class `CMS120` workspace. Make a new directory called `Lab_2` and `cd` into it:

```
mkdir Lab_2

cd Lab_2
```

You can create new files by using the file browser in the left pane or use the `touch` command in the shell:

```
touch magic_computers.py
```

## The Magic Computers

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2100/1*8M2JfaTacGjI8YQlO9qF5A.jpeg" width="50%" />

Mad Libs are a word completion game originally invented in 1953 by two New Yorkers, Leonard Stern and Roger Price, who went on to publish a series of best-selling books based on the concept.

Each Mad Lib is an incomplete short story, where some of the words have been replaced by blanks, each labeled with a part of speech. One player asks the others for words to fill in the blanks, then reads the complete story. Hilarity ensues.

Write a program to implement the "Magic Computers" Mad Lib given above. Use the input function to prompt the user to enter words of each type, then combine all of the answers together to print the finished story. Here's a little bit to help you get started:

```

"""
The Magic Computers: a Mad Lib
"""

# Prompt the user to enter all of the required words
noun1 = input('Enter a noun: ')
plural_noun1 = input('Enter a plural noun: ')

# Add more cases for the other blanks...

# Print out the story with the user's words mixed in
# %s is the format specifier for a string variable
# This is an easy way to mix string variables in with other output

print('Today, every student has a computer small enough to fit into his %s.' % noun1)
print('He can solve any math problem by simply pushing the computer\'s little %s.' % plural_noun1)

# Add more print statements for the rest of the story...
```


## The Weight

<img src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1-1470306645-800.jpg" width="50%" />

Write a program to read in a weight in kilograms and convert it to pounds. There are about 2.20462 pounds in one kilogram.
Display the result to one decimal place.

The current world record for weight lifted overhead in the clean and jerk is 263.5 kg, held by the vending-machine-sized Iranian superheavy
weightlifter [Hossein Rezazadeh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOE-PZJq2sk). Use your program to calculate the weight of Rezazadeh's record lift 
in pounds.


## Mystery Operator

Python supports a special operator, `%`, which is called the **modulus operator**.

Run the Python prompt in your terminal by typing `python3` and pressing `ENTER`. Try some calculations using the modulus operator
and see what results you get:

```
7 % 3
12 % 5
19 % 7
2 % 2
```

Can you figure out what the mod operator does? Hint: it has something to do with division.

Press `CTRL + d` to exit the Python prompt and return to your regular terminal.


## Number Fail

Recall that all of the data in our Python programs must ultimately be stored on a real, physical computer. This implies that there must be **limitations** for the range and precision of values that can be represented in code.

Run the `python3` prompt again and output the following calculation. Do you get the right answer?

```
.1 + .2
```

This is an example of **numerical error**: floating point numbers (the `float` type) can only represent some numbers approximately so 
calculations involving fractions may have very small errors.

Find another example using `float` arithmetic that doesn't give the exact result you would expect.


## Comrades

<img src="https://ultra-x.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/comrades-marathon-africa-ultra-x.jpg" width="50%" />

Write a program that can read in a number of kilometers as input and print the corresponding number of miles. There are
1.60934 kilometers in one mile.

The Comrades Maraton in South Africa is the world's oldest and largest ultramrathon race, established in 1921. 
It is run between the cities of Durban and Pietermaritzburg in South Africa, a distance of about 87 km. The race was cancelled in 2020, but more than 25000 
people participate during a normal year. The direction alternates every year, with the course beginning in Durban being mostly uphill and the other direction being mostly downhill, so there are actually two records for the course.

What is the length of Comrades Marathon in miles?


## Number Guessing Game ver. 0.01

Many programs, including simulations and games, require sequences of random numbers to model things that happen by chance.

A program that creates seqeunces of random numbers is called a **pseudorandom number generator (PRNG)**. The **pseudo-** part comes in because the numbers are not truly random; rather, they're being generated by an underlying deterministic algorithm, but in such a way that they have the same statistical properties as a random sequence (https://www.random.org/ is a service that claims to generate true random numbers by sampling naturally occurring radio noise in the atmosphere).

Python's `random` library includes a bunch of built-in functions for generating random numbers. One of its functions is `randint`, which generates a random integer from a specific range. Here's an example:

```
"""
Generate a random integer using randint
"""

from random import randint

# Generate a number in the range [1, 100], including both ends
r = randint(1, 100)

print(r)
```

The two arguments to `randint` control the range containing the randomized value.

Write a program that asks the user to guess a hidden number (picked using `randint`) then reports how close the guess was to the true value. Here's an example
of what the output should look like:

```
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100 (including both). Can you guess what it is?
Type a number: 45
Your guess is: 45
The number I was thinking of is: 14
You were off by: 31
```

There is a bulit-in function called `abs` that will calculate the absolute value of its input. Use it to find the distance between the guess and the target value, like this:

```
difference = abs(guess - target)
```
