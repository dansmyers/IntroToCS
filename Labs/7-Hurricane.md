# Hurricane Make-Up

## Overview

This is the make-up practice assignment for the week of 10/7. Each section below has a link to a video followed by practice problems. Work through the lab, completing each section in order. At the end, you'll submit your programs to an assignment on Canvas so that I have a record that everyone completed the make-up work.

This lab has a ***soft*** deadline of Tuesday, 10/15. I realize that we don't know how things will be after the storm, so I understand if you need a little extra time.

My plan is to still have the midterm next week, on Friday the 18th. This content **will** be part of the midterm.

## AI Usage

This is practice of fundamental content. If we were in-person, we'd do it in together in class, but we aren't. I'm asking you to do these questions **without using AI**. 

That's on the honor system, but be aware that you'll need to understand how lists and loops work for the midterm. It's to your advantage to work through these questions in a way that actually helps you learn the material.

You can always reach out to me if you have questions.
