### Doge II: Return of Doge

*The Doge of Venice. You can also read about the complete insanity involved in [selecting a new doge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_of_Venice#Selection_of_the_doge)*.


Complete the program below by writing a function called `usd_to_doge` that takes a number of USD as input and converts to the equivalent number of DOGE. The function should **print** the result.

Notice how the main section uses an input statement to read a value from the user, then passes that input as a parameter to the function. Don't use `input` in the function itself.

1 dollar is currently worth about 9.17 DOGE.

### Write your function definition here


### Main

# Read a number of dollars
value = float(input('Enter a number of dollars: '))

# Call a function that converts to DOGE and prints the result
usd_to_doge(value)

### Hi-Lo
