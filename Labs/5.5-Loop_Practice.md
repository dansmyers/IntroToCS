# Loop Practice

## Instructions

Create a new file for each of the following questions.


## Summation

Write a program that uses a loop to calculate the sum of all the numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by either 3 or 7 or both.

Tips:

- Use the `range` function
- Use an `if` statement inside the `for` loop to test for divisibility by 3 or 7
- Use a variable called `total` to accumulate the sum as you're looping

## Looping over a List

Suppose that you have a list of words:

```
words = ['apple', 'bandit', 'camel', 'druid', 'excellent', 'fiery', 'grandiose', 'helicopter']
```

We've seen that one way to iterate over this list is to use the basic `for` loop:

```
for w in words:
    print(word)
```

Another way to do this, which is sometimes useful, is to **loop over the indices of the list**:
```
for i in range(len(words)):
    print(words[i])
```

Take a look at this loop and figure out how it works. What is `range(len(words))` doing?

Write your own program that creates a list and loops over it using the range-based approach.


## Babylonian Square Roots

We've seen useful built-in functions like `sqrt` before. But how does your computer actually perform complex mathematical calculations like square roots?

Here's one of the most famous ancient algorithms. It's usually called the Babylonian Square Root algorithm, although it existed across the ancient world. The algorithm assumes that you want to find the square root of an input number `n`, starting from a guessed root, which we'll call `x`.

The method is iterative. On each step, update the guessed root `x` according to the following rule:

```
x = .5 * (x + n / x)
```

It turns out that this method converges to the true value of `sqrt(n)` extremely quickly, even if the initial guess `x` is far from the correct answer. For example, if `n` is 625 and the initial value of `x` is 1, the first ten iterations are as follows:

```
1
313.0
157.49840255591053
80.73334838629857
44.237441431796796
29.1828724815876
25.29977210448118
25.00177597083195
25.000000063076968
25.0
```

The method finds a very good approximation within 8 iterations and has completely converged with only two more steps.

Why does this algorithm work? Consider two cases.

1. Suppose the guess `x` is much smaller than the true square root of `n`. If so, then `n / x` should be **larger** than the true square root. The average of the two should therefore be a better approximation.

2. The same logic applies if `x` is much bigger than the true root. In that case, `n / x` should be **smaller** than the true root and the average should again be an improvement.

This argument is not exact, but it turns out that the method converges very quickly once you get within the neighborhood of the true root.

The method can also be derived using Newton's Method from Calculus, which explains its convergence behavior (Newton's Method converges quadratically fast once you are in the neighborhood of the root).

Write a program called `root.py` that reads input values of `n` and `x` from the user and then performs ten iterations of the Babylonian square root algorithm. Print out the estimate of the root at each iteration.


## Pyramid

Write a program that can print a pyramid of stars like the following:

```
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
```

Use a variable called `height` that controls the number of lines in the pyramid. Use a loop that iterates over the lines, then print the correct number of spaces on each line followed by the correct number of stars.

I recommend creating two variables called `num_spaces` and `num_stars` that keep track of the number of spaces and stars to print on each iteration of the loop. At the beginning of the program

```
num_spaces = height - 1
num_stars = 1
```

After printing, you can update the values for the next line by subtracting one space and adding two stars.

To print, use string multiplication

```
print(' ' * num_spaces, end='')
print('*' * num_stars)
```

Here, `end=''` tells Python not to automatically advance to the next line.

The general layout of your program will look like this:

```
"""
Build the pyramid
"""

# Set the number of lines
height = 10

# Initialize num_spaces and num_stars


# Loop over the number of lines (use the range function)


    # Inside the loop, print the correct number of spaces and stars for the current line
    
    
    # Inside the loop, update num_spaces and num_stars for the next iteration

```
