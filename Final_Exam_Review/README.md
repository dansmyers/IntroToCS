# Final Exam Review

## Exam Details

The exam will be 15-20 short answer questions. Every question will ask you to review a program or code fragment and predict its output. The overall purpose of the exam is to assess your mental model of how programs execute, which is an essential aspect of computational thinking.

Other information:

- No books, notes, internet access, or other resources
- No calculator; there won't be any calculations other than simple arithmetic
- **No trick questions**: every program will have valid code that produces a straightforward answer
- The standard time limit is two hours

I will grade the exam by assessing the fraction of questions you answered correctly.

- If you score 80% or higher, you'll receive full credit
- If you score at least 60% but less than 80%, you'll receive half credit
