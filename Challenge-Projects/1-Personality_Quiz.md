## Introduction

Personality quizzes. Is there a better way to learn about yourself than answering nonsensical questions written by randos on the Internet? I think not! I've taken a bunch of these over the years and I've learned all kinds of things.

- Hogwarts house? (Slytherin, but I'd pretend to be Hufflepuff).
- Disney heroine? (Maid Marian from *Robin Hood*).
- [Myers-Briggs personality type](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/the-16-mbti-types.htm)? (INTP).
- [Enneagram type](https://www.narrativeenneagram.org/tour-the-nine-types/)? (3, and far more useful than Myers-Briggs, in my opinion).
- [Pok√©mon type](https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarahtooley5/what-pokamon-type-are-you-248el1snke)? (Poison).
- [Minor villain from *Jojo's Bizarre Adventure*](https://www.buzzfeed.com/puppetmaster64/which-minor-jojo-villain-are-you-42nxcnqrfi)? (Steely Dan, and I didn't even have to make that up).

Buzzfeed is still the leading purveyor of these online quizzes, offering insight into, for example, [what kitchen appliance you are based on your food preferences](https://www.buzzfeed.com/catmjohnston/which-kitchen-appliance-are-you-based-on-your-food-8arc2wkfy8). (Microwave, apparently).

In this project, you're going to use your knowledge of culture, relationships, and Python to write a program that implements a Buzzfeed-style personality quiz. Your quiz can be about anything that you want, as long as it's your own original implementation.

The goal of this program is to write a completely self-designed program that is larger than anything we've done so far.

## Submission and Grading

Complete your program in the "Challenge Project 1" workspace on repl.it. Put your program into the file named `quiz.py`.

There are no tests for this project. I'll run your code, answer your questions, then look at your program to see how it's structured. 

This project is **optional**. If you choose to complete it, you final grade will be increased by **one part of a letter**, e.g. from B to B+. **Make sure that you officially submit your project when you finish so that I can see that it needs to be graded**.

There will be two more challenge project released later in the semester. You need to complete all three (in addition to the regular problem sets and reading) to earn an A for the course.

## Quiz Design

There are a number of ways to implement online quizzes. We're going to use the approach described in [this article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/annakopsky/everything-you-need-to-know-to-make-a-buzzfeed-personality). First, determine the title and "hook" for your quiz. What's it going to be about? Then decide on 3-6 outcomes that will be the results the user sees at the end.

Each possible answer in your quiz will correspond to one of your 3-6 final outcomes. Each time the user answers a question, assign a point to the associated outcome. At the end of the quiz, pick the final outcome with the most total points.

## Example

*G'day, mate.*

Scott's favorite animals are snakes, so I'm going to use "Which deadly Australian snake are you?" as our example. Here are four options, [sourced from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_of_Australia):

- Tiger snake
- Taipan
- Death adder
- Bandy-bandy

At the beginning of the main part, create four variables, one for each outcome:

```
tiger_snake_score = 0
taipan_score = 0
death_adder_score = 0
bandy_bandy_score = 0
```

We can then print a question and a menu of answers:

```
What is your coloration?

1. Bands of red, brown, or black with a light-colored belly.
2. Dark tan
3. Sharply contrasting black and white rings
4. Darker bands with a yellow-orange belly
```

Read the user input using our standard technique, then assign a point to the snake that matches the user's answer:

```
choice = int(input('Enter your answer: '))

if choice == 1:
    death_adder_score += 1
elif choice == 2:
    taipan_score += 1
elif choice == 3:
    bandy_bandy_score += 1
else:
    tiger_snake_score += 1
```

Here, I'm using `+= 1` as a shortcut to add one to a variable.


## Code

```
"""
What deadly Australian snake are you?
"""

# Use functions for multiline outputs to keep the main part of the program
# free from big blocks of print statements

def print_question_one():
  print()
  print('What is your coloration?')
  print('1. Bands of red, brown, or black with a light-colored belly')
  print('2. Dark tan')
  print('3. Sharply contrasting black and white rings')
  print('4. Darker bands with a yellow-orange belly')
  print()


### Main

# Declare variables for each outcome
tiger_snake_score = 0
taipan_score = 0
death_adder_score = 0
bandy_bandy_score = 0

# Print the first question
print_question_one()

# Read the answer and assign a point to its associated outcome
choice = int(input('Enter your answer: '))

if choice == 1:
    death_adder_score += 1
elif choice == 2:
    taipan_score += 1
elif choice == 3:
    bandy_bandy_score += 1
else:
    tiger_snake_score += 1


# More questions would go here...


# Determine which outcome has the most points, then print out
# a result message
```

## More Guidelines

- Choose your own topic with 3-6 possible outcomes.
- Write at least four questions.
- Use functions to wrap up the print statements for your questions and final output messages. Putting big chunks of text behind a function call keeps the main part of the program from getting overloaded with print statements (and also lets you practice writing your own functions).

You'll need to decide how to determine the answer with the most points, including how to break ties. Write a function called `print_result` that takes all of your score variables as input, chooses the winner, and prints an appropriate message as the conclusion of your quiz.
