## Description

I’ve decided to open a new restaurant and I need your help coming up with the menu. This place is going to be slick and hip, with all kinds of exposed ductwork, bricks, 
and those old-timey lightbulbs, so it needs a hip menu to match. In fact, I think the menu should be **randomly generated** using a context-free grammar.

In this project, you’re going to write a page that uses JavaScript and DOM-manipulation to automatically create a restaurant menu.

The goal of this project is to have you experiment with creating a more complex web application that uses more advanced DOM-manipulation. In particular, you'll need to practice understanding the starting code well enough to modify to add more items to the menu.

## Instructions

Your menu is going to have three sections: appetizers, mains, and desserts. Each section should use a different set of ingredients and preparations and different generation 
rules so that the menu items are unique. Put at least three items in each section.

I've given you an `index.html` that generates the appetizers section as a starting point. Use the code as a template to finish the other two sections. You can 
modify the ingredients and options for the appetizers if you want to use my choices in other sections.

Once you have all three sections generating, give your restaurant its own name and modify the hip styling so your page has its own look.
