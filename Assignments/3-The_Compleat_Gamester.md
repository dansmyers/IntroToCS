# Assignment 3: The Compleat Gamester

This problem set will let you practice writing some simple text-based games that are based around random events like rolling dice. Along the way you'll get to practice

-Using the built-in `random` module
-More user input
-Testing for valid input
-Using conditional statements
-Using logical operations
-More formatted printing
-The modulus operator
-Integer division

These problems are all more challenging than the ones in the previous assignment.

The title of this assignment comes from an early English book on gaming,Â *The Compleat Gamester*, published in 1674 and attributed to Charles Cotton, a writer with a penchant for compleatness: He also contributed to a book called The Compleat Angler ("Being a difcourfe of FISH and FISHING not unworthy of the perufal of moft Anglers.")
