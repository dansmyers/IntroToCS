### Our Princess is in Another Castle

At the end of each level of the original Super Mario Bros., Mario jumps up a staircase like the following:

```
     ##
    ###
   ####
  #####
 ######
#######
```

The staircase has six levels. The bottom level has seven blocks and the top level has five spaces and two blocks.
Write a program that uses six print statements to print this staircase.

### Haiku

Write a program to print the following haiku by the poet Kobayashi Issa.

```
O snail
Climb Mount Fuji,
But slowly, slowly!
```

Use three print statements, one for each line.

Tips:

- Your output must match the format of the poem exactly to pass the test.
- Remember to start the program with a docstring.


### Beards

The beard-second is an incredibly scientific unit of length defined as the distance an average beard grows in 1 second. Google defines the beard-second as 5 nanometers and will perform conversions between beard-seconds and other lengths (try typing “1 foot in beard-seconds” into Google).


Using this definition, it would take an average beard 58.8 days to grow 1 inch.


The longest beard in the world is 17 feet long and is housed in the Smithsonian institution. In life, it belonged to Hans Langseth, who immigrated to the U.S. from Norway in 1864; he died in North Dakota in 1927. He would wrap his beard around a corncob and carry it in his pocket.
