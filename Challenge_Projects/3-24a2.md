## Due 12/2 (the last day of classes)

## Description

[24a2](https://24a2.routley.io/) is a simple engine for web-based games developed by James Routley. All 24a2 games are written in JavaScript and played in the web browser using a grid of 24x24 dots. The engine provides methods to easily set the color of a dot and respond to key presses.

The project is straightforward: build the demo game given in the [tutorial](https://24a2.routley.io/tutorial/). It shows off all of the essential functions. You can play the game [here](https://24a2.routley.io/games/tutorial/).

After you finish the basic game, make a few upgrades:

- Add a new type of item (with a unique color) that counts for more points.
- Add a new type of item (again, with its own color) that adds more time back to the timer.
- Add one more feature of your own choice.

## Submission

Use the workspace on repl.it. Put all of your code in `game.js`. You do not need to edit `index.html`.

## Tips

There are only three methods that contain all of the code for the game:

- `create` runs one time at the beginning of the game and performs initialization

- `update` runs repeatedly in a timed loop; it contains all of the game logic and drawing code

- `onKeyPress` runs whenever the user presses a key; it contains code that checks the key and does something in response

The player's state is controlled by a dictionary (JavaScript calls these structures *objects*, but they work like Python's dictionaries). The declaration

```
player = {
  x: 5,
  y: 10,
};
```

creates a dictionary named `player` and assigns it two entries, `x` and `y`, mapped to the values of 5 and 10 respectively.

Graphics in 24a2 are simply colored dots. The main drawing code is:

```
game.setDot(player.x, player.y, Color.Black);
```

The first two arguments are the x and y position of the dot in the 24 x 24 grid and the last is the color. Suggestion: after implementing the basic `create`  and `update` methods, experiment with changing the starting position and color of the dot.

The game also creates an array of items. Looping over the contents of an array is simple in JavaScript; the loop below steps through the elements of the `items` array one at a time and draws each item to the screen as a green dot.

```
for (item of items) {
  game.setDot(item.x, item.y, Color.Green);
}
```

## Other Games

You might like to try making a game with 24a2 as a final project. Here are a few more ideas for you to try out:

- [Snake](https://24a2.routley.io/games/snake/)
- [Samegame](https://kentbrew.neocities.org/samegame/): clear the board by clicking on dots
- [You Killed a Bear But Now You're Dying From Blood Loss: The Game](https://craigmbooth.com/projects/ykab/)
