# Challenge Project: Personality Quiz

## Due 

## Introduction

Personality quizzes. Is there a better way to learn about yourself than answering strange questions written by randos on the Internet? I think not!

- Which Hogwarts house are you in? (Slytherin, but I'd pretend to be Hufflepuff).
- Which Disney heroine are you? (Maid Marian from *Robin Hood*).
- [Myers-Briggs personality type](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/the-16-mbti-types.htm)? (INTP).
- [Enneagram type](https://www.narrativeenneagram.org/tour-the-nine-types/)? (3, and far more useful than Myers-Briggs, in my opinion).
- [What Pok√©mon type are you](https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarahtooley5/what-pokamon-type-are-you-248el1snke)? (Poison).

Buzzfeed is still the leading purveyor of these online quizzes, offering, for example, insight into how "[Your controversial anime opinions will reveal your true Hogwarts house](https://www.buzzfeed.com/shualien/tell-us-some-of-your-unpopular-anime-opinions-and-aailsw3wr0)" (*MHA* is overrated).
