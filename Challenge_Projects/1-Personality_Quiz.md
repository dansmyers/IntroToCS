# Challenge Project: Personality Quiz

## Due 

## Introduction

Personality quizzes: we've all taken them and learned so much about ourselves.

- Which Hogwarts house are you in? (Slytherin, but I'd pretend to be Hufflepuff).
- Which Disney princess are you? (Maid Marian from *Robin Hood*).
- Myers-Briggs personality type? (INTP).
- [Enneagram type](https://www.narrativeenneagram.org/tour-the-nine-types/)? (3, and far more useful than Myers-Briggs, in my opinion).
- [What Pok√©mon type are you](https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarahtooley5/what-pokamon-type-are-you-248el1snke)? (Poison).
